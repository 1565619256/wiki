Here are the basics

## Building
Building things is very simple. First, select what you want to build from your currently unlocked blocks in the bottom right. When you select it, you will get an in-game tutorial.

"in game tutorial here"


To leave build mode, click the same block icon again to de-select it.

You can confirm builds while paused! However, you will only build these blocks with your mech, which can only be done when the game is not paused.

You can only confirm builds if it is close enough to your ship. Starting mech is 18 tile radius. If you try to build too far away from your mech, there will either be no build option (tapping does nothing!) or it will show up as a red box (click and drag from inside range to outside range or click and drag from outside range to inside range)

Spirit drones and phantom drones will build for you! You
