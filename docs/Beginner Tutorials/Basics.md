Here are the basics

## Mech Mining
If you do not start near copper patches, it might be difficult to begin your game. Having copper income is the very first thing you need to setup, because all drills and conveyors use soley copper. 

To mine, tap on a single ore sqare. The mech will start mining with a laser. You will see ore flying out of the patch. 

If a copper mine is close enough to your core, your mech will automatically put the mined ore into inventory.
If a copper mine is not close enogh, the mined ore will fly onto your mech. There is not a good way to determine how much ore your mech is carrying, but your mech will stop mining once it is full. 
You can only hold one type of material at a time.
To drop off the mined ore or current mech inventory, tap and hold on a spot near your mech. A small icon (a circle with the ore icon) will appear. Drag this over the core to deposit it in your core inventory. Drag it into any other crafter to drop it off in the block. Drag it to an empty space to discard it. 

You can pick things off of a conveyor. Click on the conveyor. The conveyor contects will show up. Tap on the icon to pick it off the belt and add it to your mech's inventory. This is very useful when there is one material blocking the path due to a contamination or error. 

## Spirit Drone
A single spirit drone will spawn for you. The drone will mine, help build, and repare blocks. If the drone dies, a new one will build from the core shortly. 

## Building
Building things is very simple. First, select what you want to build from your currently unlocked blocks in the bottom right. When you select it, you will get an in-game tutorial.

- To leave build mode, click the same block icon again to de-select it.

- You can confirm builds while paused! However, you will only build these blocks with your mech, which can only be done when the game is not paused.

- You can only confirm builds if it is close enough to your ship. Starting mech is 18 tile radius. If you try to build too far away from your mech, there will either be no build option (tapping does nothing!) or it will show up as a red box (click and drag from inside range to outside range or click and drag from outside range to inside range)

- Spirit drones and phantom drones will build for you! You
### Tips and Tricks
- You can confirm a block, cancel the build (this will stop your mech from building, but the confirmed build will remain) and continue this one block a time to set up a large queue. This can be helpful when you want to get something started, but need to address something else first.
