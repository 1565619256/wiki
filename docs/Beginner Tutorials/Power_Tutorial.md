This is a full tutorial on how to setup and utilize power. To properly understand proper ratios, please see the Analysis tab. 

## Intro

Some blocks need power to run. To determine if a block needs power, click on the '?' icon when clicking on a block in the build screen. The block will need power if it has:

Power <br>
    Power Capacity: X power units <br>
    Power use: Y power units/second <br>

All of the blocks in the power build menu (in the build menu, the lightning bolt icon category) do not need power, but will either supply power or distribute power. 

### Power Capacity
Power capacity is how much power the block stores. If it is producing extra power, it will start to build power capacity. This is shown with a yellow bar when clicking on the block. If the yellow bar is empty or very low, most or all of it's power is being tranfered to the block that is using power. If the power block has a full yellow bar, it has produced more than enough power and will now stop producing power. 

### Power Use
A block that uses power has a power use stat and also has power capacity. The block will use all power to try and meet its power use requirements. If not enough power is supplied, a crossed off lightning icon will apear when clicking on the block, the yellow bar will be low, and the block will have drastically reduced production.

## Setting up Power

The first thing to be aware of is POWER GENERATION BLOCKS SHARE POWER IF THEY ARE TOUCHING. This includes power nodes! 

See example

Power Nodes connect to 4 things. Because power generation blocks touching act like one big power source,a node can connect to any item in the network. 

To connect something using a power node, click the node. The range of the node will show up. Then all available options for connection will appear as a red circle. Currently connected blocks will be a blue circle with a yellow wire connection. Once the node has used all of its available connections, all possible blocks will have a red cirlce with a red cross in it.

Power recommendations:

Burn coal to get silicone setup
use water for turbines or faster coal production (ratio source needed)
use solar panels to start thorium
setup thorium reactor (use solar for water generation)
