This is a full tutorial on how to setup and utilize power. To properly understand proper ratios, please see the Analysis tab. 

## Intro

Some blocks need power to run. To determine if a block needs power, click on the '?' icon when clicking on a block in the build screen. The block will need power if it has:

Power
    Power Capacity: X power units
    Power use: Y power units/second

All of the blocks in the power build menu (in the build menu, the lightning bolt icon category) do not need power, but will either supply power or distribute power. 

### Power Capacity
Power capacity is how much power the block stores. If it is producing extra power, it will start to build power capacity. This is shown with a yellow bar when clicking on the block. If the yellow bar is empty or very low, most or all of it's power is being tranfered to the block that is using power. If the power block has a full yellow bar, it has produced more than enough power and will now stop producing power. 

### Power Use
A block that uses power has a power use stat and also has power capacity. The block will use all power to try and meet its power use requirements. If not enough power is supplied, a crossed off lightning icon will apear when clicking on the block, the yellow bar will be low, and the block will have drastically reduced production.
