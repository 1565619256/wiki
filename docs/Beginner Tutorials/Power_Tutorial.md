This is a full tutorial on how to setup and utilize power. To properly understand proper ratios, please see the Analysis tab. 

## Intro

Many blocks later on in the game need power to run. To determine if a block needs power, click on the '?' icon when clicking on a block in the build screen. The block will need power if it says:

```
Power
    Power Capacity: *n* power units
    Power use: *n* power units/second
```

You can also determine if a block needs power by hovering your mouse over it and checking the yellow icons on the left. If it has a lightning icon with a red mark, that means it requires power.

All of the blocks in the power build menu (in the build menu, the lightning bolt icon category) do not need power, but will either produce or distribute power. 

### Power Capacity
Power capacity is how much power the block stores. If it is producing extra power, it will start to build power capacity. This is shown with a yellow bar when clicking on the block. If the yellow bar is empty or very low, most or all of it's power is being used. If the power block has a full yellow bar, it has produced more than enough power and will then stop producing it.

### Power Use
A block that uses power has a power use stat and also has power capacity. The block will use all power that is needed to meet its power use requirements. If not enough power is supplied, a crossed off lightning icon will appear when clicking on the block, the yellow bar will be low, and the block will have drastically reduced production.

## Setting up Power

The first thing to be aware of is **power generation blocks share power when they are touching**. This includes power nodes!

*Two small power nodes are touching each other while the third one is touching the Pulverizer, which is getting full power.*

Small Power Nodes, which are 1x1 in size, connect to a maximum of 4 things. Because power generation blocks touching act like one big power source, a node can connect to any item in the network. 

To connect something using a power node, click the node. The range of the node will show up. Then all available options for connection will appear as a red circle. Currently connected blocks will be a purple circle with a yellow wire connection. Once the node has used all of its available connections, all possible blocks will have a red circle with a red cross in it.

### Power recommendations:

Burn coal to get silicon setup
use water for turbines or faster coal production (ratio source needed)
use solar panels to start thorium
setup thorium reactor (use solar for water generation)
