Here are some advanced topics / strategies.

## Routers

Routers are spliters and take 1 to 3 inputs and output evenly to 1 to 3 outputs. 
Routers can only have 1 type of material in it at the same time.
Routers take the direction of the Conveyor to determine an input vs an output. a Conveyor facing towards the Router is an input. A Conveyor facint away or tangent will be considered an output.

Because routers can be an input and an output, two routers should never touch and a router should never touch a crafting block (a block that has inputs and outputs). This is called Router Chaining and it is a valid strategy as long as each router is separated by at least one Conveyor. 

The reason Routers should not touch (or touch crafting blocks) is because a Router acts like a input and an outout at the same time. Normally, you are using a Router to move material from one spot to another, splitting it on the way to fit multiple outputs. When two Routers are touching, the further Router will output to the closer Router, which is the opposite direction of where the material should go. This causes feedback loops, clogging, and delays. 
When a Router is touching a crafting block, the finished product will sometimes output to a Router. Routers can only hold one type of material. When the finished product goese into the router, it now has no where to go, clogging the incoming raw material to never be able to enter the crafting block.

By separating every Router with a Conveyor, you **lock** the inputs and outputs. A Router will use the orientation of the Conveyors as indication of where inputs and outputs should go.

All of these rules apply for Distributors too. The only difference is the Distributor has 8 slots for inputs and outputs. You can use it to take 1 to 7 inputs and output 1 up to 7 outputs.
