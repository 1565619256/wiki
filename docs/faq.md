# Frequently Asked Questions

## Why are you charging for the game on Steam and iOS when it is available for free?

The game is being charged for on Steam and iOS because it is one way of supporting Anuke, and it has features not available on the free versions, such as:

- A map, mod, and schematic browser
- Secure, seamless multiplayer using Steam Multiplayer (eliminates the need to port-forward)
- Publicly visible servers at startup
- Achievements
- Stat tracking
- Cloud saves and progress transfer using Steam
- Steam community

On the App Store, distributing the game there costs a lot, as a developer will need a Mac, and a $100/year developer license to do so. Such expenses are covered by charging for the game on there.

## How can I contribute to the game? 

- The easiest way is to give constructive feedback and discussion (preferably about the game) in our Discord Server.
- Report bugs that you find on the GitHub repository. **Please remember to use the templates properly**, as doing so will make your issue more organized and follow a common pattern, making Anuke's job easier. If you know how to program in Java, feel free to help Anuke out and fix said bugs, then open a PR. 
- Donations to Anuke are open on the Itch.io page if you would like to give a monetary contribution. You can also buy the game on Steam.
- If you are fluent in a language that Mindustry doesn't support yet, or if you want to contribute to the ones already there, stop by the #translations channel, and ask about it. You can contribute to the current bundles and open a PR in the game's repo.
- If you want to contribute to this wiki, please contact Anuke or Luxray5474. They'll let you know what you should do and how we roll.
