# Frequently Asked Questions

## Why are you charging for the game on Steam and iOS when it is available for free?

The game is being charged for on Steam and iOS because it is one way of supporting Anuke. You have the choice of getting the game for free or not, just like in Itch.io. You can choose to get the Steam version or get the regular desktop release. Unfortunately this is not possible on the App Store [anuke you will know this]

## How can I contribute to the game? 

- The easiest way is to give constructive feedback and discussion (preferably about the game) in our Discord Server.
- Report bugs that you find **on the Discord Server rather than the Issues section on the GitHub repository**. If you know how to program in Java, feel free to help Anuke out and fix said bugs, then open a PR. 
- Donations to Anuke are open on the Itch.io page if you would like to give a monetary contribution. You can also buy the game on Steam.
- If you are fluent in a language that Mindustry doesn't support yet, or if you want to contribute to the ones already there, stop by the #translations channel, and ask about it. You can contribute to the current bundles and open a PR in the game's repo.
- If you want to contribute to this wiki, please contact Anuke or Luxray. They'll let you know what you should do and how we roll.
