# Characteristics

## Items 

[Here](../items/) is where these are applied.

### Flags 

Flags are described over at the page.

### Cost

Cost is how much time an item adds to the time it takes to build a block that uses it. One `cost` = one tick added to build time.

For example, the Battery requires 8CP<img src="../img/cp.png" id="spr">, 30LE<img src="../img/le.png" id="spr">, and 4SI<img src="../img/si.png" id="spr">. The build time is processed like this:

`(0.6 * 8) + (0.9 * 30) + (0.9 * 8) = 39`

Therefore, it takes 39 ticks to build a Battery by yourself.

### Hardness

The time it takes to mine one item is partially dependent on the hardness of an item. Sand is the least hardest, while Thorium is the hardest. 

[needs correction] For example, mining Copper with your Mining Laser gets you copper much faster than when mining Thorium. That is because Thorium is harder than Copper. 

### Radioactivity

Radioactivity is the potency of the material in nuclear-based blocks like the RTG. In said block, Thorium generates more electricity than Phase because it is much more radioactive.

### Flammability

As it suggests, it is the measure of flammability of an item. It is also the speed at which it burns and the speed at which it spreads across blocks that are made of it, and enemies which are hit by it as a projectile. 

For example, Plastanium<img src="../img/pl.png" id="spr"> burns slower than coal<img src="../img/co.png" id="spr">, which burns much slower than Pyratite<img src="../img/py.png" id="spr">. Furthermore, when Pyratite is used as ammo, it will burn enemies faster and stronger than Blast Compound<img src="../img/bc.png" id="spr">.

**Tip:** Make sure distribution blocks (Conveyors, Vaults, Bridges) that contain flammable or explosive materials are protected and kept away from potential damage, like a Reactor or enemy path. For example, if a Reactor explodes near a conveyor with Coal, the majority of the conveyor will immediately explode because of the Coal on it.

### Explosiveness

As it suggest, it is the measure of explosiveness of an item. That is most useful in an ammunition application, where the most explosive item will deal the largest damage over the largest area. Blast Compound<img src="../img/bc.png" id="spr"> is the most explosive item as its name, "Blast", suggests.

**Tip:** Keep explosive material protected and separate from your Core or any exposed lines, unless it is needed. It is highly explosive and when triggered, will deal amage to surrounding blocks as well. Read the previous tip, too.
