# Characteristics

## Items 

[Here](../items/) is where these are applied.

### Flags 

Flags are described over at the page.

### Cost

Cost is how much time an item adds to the time it takes to build a block that uses it. One `cost` = one tick added to build time.

For example, the Battery requires 8CP<img src="../img/cp.png" id="spr">, 30LE<img src="../img/le.png" id="spr">, and 4SI<img src="../img/si.png" id="spr">. The build time is processed like this:

`(0.6 * 8) + (0.9 * 30) + (0.9 * 8) = 39`

Therefore, it takes 39 ticks to build a Battery by yourself.

### Hardness

The time it takes to mine one item is partially dependent on the hardness of an item. Sand is the least hardest, while Thorium is the hardest. 

[needs correction] For example, mining Copper with your Mining Laser gets you copper much faster than when mining Thorium. That is because Thorium is harder than Copper. 

### Radioactivity

Radioactivity is the potency of the material in nuclear-based blocks like the RTG. In said block, Thorium generates more electricity than Phase because it is much more radioactive.

### Flammability

As it suggests, it is the measure of flammability of an item. It is also the speed at which it burns and the speed at which it spreads across blocks that are made of it, and enemies which are hit by it as a projectile. 

For example, Plastanium burns slower than coal, which burns much slower than Pyratite. Furthermore, when Pyratite is used as ammo, it will burn enemies faster and stronger than Blast Compound.

**Tip:** Make sure distribution blocks (Conveyors, Vaults, Bridges) that contain flammable or explosive materials are protected and kept away from potential damage, like a Reactor or enemy path. For example, if a Reactor explodes near a conveyor with Coal, the majority of the conveyor will immediately explode because of the Coal on it.
