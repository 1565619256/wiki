# Characteristics

## Items 

[Here](../items/) is where these are applied.

### Flags 

Flags are described over at the page.

### Cost

Cost is how much time an item adds to the time it takes to build a block that uses it. One `cost` = one tick added to build time.

For example, the Battery requires 8CP<img src="../img/cp.png" id="spr">, 30LE<img src="../img/le.png" id="spr">, and 4SI<img src="../img/si.png" id="spr">. The build time is processed like this:

`(0.6 * 8) + (0.9 * 30) + (0.9 * 8) = 39`

Therefore, it takes 39 ticks to build a Battery by yourself.
