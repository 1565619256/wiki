# Items

Items are one of the integral parts of Mindustry. They can serve as fuel, ammo, or building material.

## Flags 

* N - Naturally generated
* M - Man-made, e.g. with a Production or Crafting block
* E - Can be obtained from destroying an enemy
* B - Is used as a building material

## Copper <img id="spr" src="../img/cp.png"> 

The beginner's material; the most basic one for the most basic blocks, used as the most basic ammo. When melted with Lead, Dense Alloy is produced. 

**Obtainable with:** All drills, Separator, Centrifuge

### Basic Information

This is the primary material in Mindustry. A lot of blocks are made of it, and it is usually highly abundant. When melted with Lead using a Smelter or Arc Smelter, Dense Alloy is produced, which opens up more possibilities and better blocks. Since it is the primary material, it is also easily mineable by any drill.

### Characteristics 

Copper appears as a brown or bronze colored ore, which looks strangely like a small loaf of bread. It has no special properties. 

### History

Copper was added in 4.0 (subject to change) as a replacement for Tungsten.

<hr>

## Lead 

A heavy, waterproof material. When melted with Copper, Dense Alloy is produced. It is also used as a major ingredient for power-related things.

**Obtainable with:** All drills, Separator, Centrifuge

### Basic Information

The second material you encounter, it is one of the fundementals. Dense Alloy gets its density from the Lead that makes it up. This material has waterproof and electrical properties, making it the basic material for liquid-related blocks like the Conduit, and for power blocks like the Combustion generator.

### Characteristics

Waterproof and dense. It appears as a heather or mauve bar, similar to the appearance of [Ube or purple yams](https://panlasangpinoy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Ube-Halaya-Recipe.jpg?x28997).

### History 

Lead was added in 4.0.

## Coal 

The basic fuel. It can be used as fuel by a Combustion Generator to generate power. It is also used by the Smelter as fuel to make Dense Alloy.

## Sand 

Used to make Silicon, and as flux. Other than that, it's unfortunate you can't throw some towards enemies.

## Stone <img id="spr" src="../img/st.png"> 

A material that is common at times and *almost* useless. It can be turned to sand and be melted into Lava, though, and can be used by a Separator or Centrifuge to output various different ores. 

**Obtainable with:** Pneumatic Drill, Laser Drill, Airblast Drill, Separator, Centrifuge

Stone is part of the terrain, and is abundant usually in maps that also have sand. Because it is harder than a usual ore, it takes advanced drills, Pneumatic and above, to mine it. Since ores are found in the ground - in rocks and terrain - mined rocks can contain said ores, which can conveniently be extracted using a Separator or Centrifuge. That is especially useful in worlds where ore patches are scarce, while rock is abundant.

## Titanium

A cool and speedy material. By that I mean it makes items go faster and is an ingredient for a liquid that cools down blocks quicker than water.

## Thorium

Watch out, this thing is radioactive! When used in a controlled environment such as in a Reactor and cooled, it generates massive amounts of power.

## Dense Alloy 

A strong material, suitable for walls, mechs, blocks, and even half-decent ammo.

## Silicon

We're entering the technology age with this material. Make computerized units that can fight for you, or make even more electricity.

## Plastanium

To say it short, a C4 bomb disguised as green cheese play food.

## Phase Fabric

These may look like stalks of wheat but please don't put them in your mouth. They are radioactive, and will also probably turn you into air.

## Surge Alloy

Having this electrifying Kraft Singles American Cheese means you've played through enough that you can contribute to discussions on the Discord. Other than walls and ammo, though, they're pretty plain.

## Biomatter

Somehow this saturated goosecrap can be burned.

## Blast Compound

Kaboom. 20 enemies clustered together is nothing for this powerful ammo.

## Pyratite

Let your enemies and their bases burn. This material is the most flammable, as its name (pyra) suggests.
