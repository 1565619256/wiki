## Copper <img id="spr" src="../img/cp.png"> 

The beginner's material; the most basic one for the most basic blocks, used as the most basic ammo. When melted with Lead, Dense Alloy is produced. 

**Obtainable with:** All drills, Separator, Centrifuge

### Basic Information

This is the primary material in Mindustry. A lot of blocks are made of it, and it is usually highly abundant. When melted with Lead using a Smelter or Arc Smelter, Dense Alloy is produced, which opens up more possibilities and better blocks. Since it is the primary material, it is also easily mineable by any drill.

### Characteristics 

Copper appears as a brown or bronze colored ore, which looks strangely like a small loaf of bread. It has no special properties. 

### History

Copper was added in 4.0 (subject to change) as a replacement for Tungsten.

<hr>

## Lead <img id="spr" src="../img/le.png"> 

A heavy, waterproof material. When melted with Copper, Dense Alloy is produced. It is also used as a major ingredient for power-related things.

**Obtainable with:** All drills, Separator, Centrifuge

### Basic Information

The second material you encounter, it is one of the fundamentals. Thus, like Copper, it is mineable by any drill. Dense Alloy gets its density from the Lead that makes it up. This material has waterproof and electrical properties, making it the basic material for liquid-related blocks like the Conduit, and for power blocks like the Combustion generator.

### Characteristics

Waterproof and dense. It appears as a heather or mauve bar, similar to the appearance of [Ube or purple yams](https://panlasangpinoy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Ube-Halaya-Recipe.jpg?x28997). It appears on the ground as an ore of its color.

### History 

Lead was added in 4.0.

<hr>

## Coal <img id="spr" src="../img/co.png"> 

The basic, reliable fuel. 

**Obtainable with:** All drills, Separator, Centrifuge

### Basic Information

Coal is the first and basic fuel. It fuels fire to generate electricity or to melt lead and copper together. It also is an ingredient in the process of silicon production.

**WARNING:** Because of its high flammability, **avoid putting it into your core or connected vaults!** The instant a fire hits said systems, they will blow one by one like a fuse. **See [Characteristics > Flammability](../characteristics/#flammability-items-liquids) for further information.**

### Characteristics

Coal is quite flammable, making it a good fuel. It appears as a black, almost circular stone, just like in real life at times. It is found as a black ore.

### History

Coal has existed since the first release of Mindustry.

<hr>

## Sand <img id="spr" src="../img/sa.png">

Used to make Silicon, and as flux.

**Obtainable with:** All drills, Separator, Centrifuge

### Basic Information

Sand is the material you need to step up your game. When used strategically with Arc Smelters, they can greatly improve the efficiency of Dense Alloy production, and conserve resources. It also the second ingredient for Silicon.

Strategically speaking, Sand, again, is a must-have. Many players like to have large amounts of sand harvested and stored, usually passively (using passive drills). Therefore, they can have an always-ready supply of flux. 

### Characteristics

Sand is light-yellow colored, and looks like... well, a pile of sand. It appears on the ground as terrain. 

### History

Sand was added in 4.0.

<hr>

## Stone <img id="spr" src="../img/st.png"> [ DEPRECATED ] 

A material that is common at times and *almost* useless. It can be turned to sand and be melted into Lava, though, and can be used by a Separator or Centrifuge to output various different ores. 

**Obtainable with:** Pneumatic Drill, Laser Drill, Airblast Drill, Separator, Centrifuge

Stone is part of the terrain, and is abundant usually in maps that also have sand. Because it is harder than a usual ore, it takes advanced drills, Pneumatic and above, to mine it. Since ores are found in the ground - in rocks and terrain - mined rocks can contain said ores, which can conveniently be extracted using a Separator or Centrifuge. That is especially useful in worlds where ore patches are scarce, while rock is abundant.

<hr>

## Titanium <img id="spr" src="../img/ti.png">

A cool and speedy material. 

**Obtainable with:** Pneumatic Drill, Laser Drill, Airblast Drill, Separator, Centrifuge

### Basic Information

Titanium is the next biggest step after Dense Alloy. Upgrade regular Conveyors to Titanium Conveyors to make them faster, and make more advanced blocks and units! Titanium, when mixed with water in a Cryofluid Mixer, produces Cryofluid, a coolant vastly better than water. 

### Characteristics 

This cool blue material can be found as an ore. It looks like a blue 'bar', similar to Copper and Lead. 

### History

Titanium was added in 4.0.

<hr>

## Thorium <img id="spr" src="../img/th.png">

A pink, radioactive material. It can be used to generate large amounts of electricity, and as an ammo.

**Obtainable with:** Laser Drill, Airblast Drill, Separator, Centrifuge

### Basic Information

Thorium is an ore that comes fairly late in the game. To first obtain it, a Laser Drill can be used, then an Airblast Drill as soon as possible. It usually naturally appears in fairly large patches on the ground. 

One of the most important uses of Thorium is power generation. The Thorium Reactor is unlocked soon after the ore is obtained, which can be used with it to generate massive amounts of electricity. Careful, though, and make sure that you provide sufficient coolant to the reactor. Later on, after Phase Fabric is obtained, the RTG is unlocked, which is sort of a smaller and safer version of the Thorium Reactor.

[ammo information yet to come]

### Characteristics

Thorium is pink and radioactive. It appears as an ore on the ground. Some say the sprite looks like a heart, and others say it looks like a T (for Thorium). Still others say it resembles bubble gum.

### History

Thorium was added in 4.0, as a replacement to <3.5's Uranium. They and their reactors share many of the same characteristics.

<hr>

## Dense Alloy [ DEPRECATED ] 

**Replaced with: Metaglass**

A strong material, suitable for walls, mechs, blocks, and even half-decent ammo.

## Silicon

We're entering the technology age with this material. Make computerized units that can fight for you, or make even more electricity.

## Plastanium

To say it short, a C4 bomb disguised as green cheese play food.

## Phase Fabric

These may look like stalks of wheat but please don't put them in your mouth. They are radioactive, and will also probably turn you into air.

## Surge Alloy

Having this electrifying Kraft Singles American Cheese means you've played through enough that you can contribute to discussions on the Discord. Other than walls and ammo, though, they're pretty plain.

## Biomatter [ DEPRECATED ]

**Replaced with: Spore Pods**

Somehow this saturated goosecrap can be burned.

## Blast Compound

Kaboom. 20 enemies clustered together is nothing for this powerful ammo.

## Pyratite

Let your enemies and their bases burn. This material is the most flammable, as its name (pyra) suggests.
