## Stone

A material that is common and almost useless. It can be turned to sand and be melted into Lava, though.

## Sand 

Used to make Silicon, and as flux. Other than that, it's unfortunate you can't throw some towards enemies.

## Copper 

The beginner's material; the most basic one for the most basic blocks, used as the most basic ammo. When melted with Lead, Dense Alloy is produced. 

## Lead 

A heavy material, though that doesn't matter. When melted with Copper, Dense Alloy is produced. It is also used as a major ingredient for power-related things.

## Coal 

The basic fuel. It can be used as fuel by a Combustion Generator to generate power. It is also used by the Smelter as fuel to make Dense Alloy.

## Titanium

A cool and speedy material. By that I mean it makes items go faster and is an ingredient for a liquid that cools down blocks quicker than water.

## Thorium

Watch out, this thing is radioactive! When used in a controlled environment such as in a Reactor and cooled, it generates massive amounts of power.

## Dense Alloy 

A strong material, suitable for walls, mechs, blocks, and even half-decent ammo.

## Silicon

We're entering the technology age with this material. Make computerized units that can fight for you, or make even more electricity.

## Plastanium

To say it short, a C4 bomb disguised as green cheese play food.

## Phase Fabric

These may look like stalks of wheat but please don't put them in your mouth. They are radioactive, and will also probably turn you into air.

## Surge Alloy

Having this electrifying Kraft Singles American Cheese means you've played through enough that you can contribute to discussions on the Discord. Other than walls and ammo, though, they're pretty plain.

## Biomatter

Somehow this saturated goosecrap can be burned.

## Blast Compound

Kaboom. 20 enemies clustered together is nothing for this powerful ammo.

## Pyratite

Let your enemies and their bases burn. This material is the most flammable, as its name (pyra) suggests.
