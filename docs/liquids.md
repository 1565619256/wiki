# Liquids

Liquids are another core part of Mindustry. They can be used to boost production blocks, as ammo, as an ingredient, and even as a coolant. Some have status effects that can be transferred.

## Water <img id="ind" src="../img/water.png">

Water is the first liquid in Mindustry. It is dark blue in color and naturally found in bodies of water.

**Obtainable with:** Mechanical Pump, Rotary Pump, Thermal Pump, Water Extractor

### Basic Information

Water is naturally the most abundant liquid. As a result, it is also the easiest to obtain. 

It can be used as ammo for some turrets such as the Wave. It is also used as coolant for the Thorium Reactor and Force Projector, plus as a boost for higher tier Turrets. It also boosts the production rate of Drills by 1.6.

Water can also be used in the process of creating power, either as a (previously mentioned) coolant for the Thorium Reactor, or as a direct ingredient in the Turbine Generator.

In the process of obtaining Oil by Fracking using an Oil Extractor, it is needed along with sand. That is because fracking in reality uses water and sand, along with chemicals, to push the oil out of cracks in the ground.

Earlier it was mentioned that it can be used as ammo for the Wave. In that case, the Wave will automatically shoot water on blocks and terrain that are on fire. This is effective in situations where fire enemies like Titans are abundant and set blocks on fire constantly, or when there is a fire spreading.

### Characteristics

Water is blue and dark blue (for 'deep water'), and naturally appears in bodies as small as puddles or as big as oceans.

### History

Water has existed since the beginning of Mindustry.
