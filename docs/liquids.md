# Liquids

Liquids are another core part of Mindustry. They can be used to boost production blocks, as ammo, as an ingredient, and even as a coolant. Some have status effects that can be transferred

## Water
 
<img width=150px align="right" src="../img/water.png">

Water is the first liquid in Mindustry. It is dark blue in color and naturally found in bodies of water.

**It can be obtained using:**

* Mechanical Pump 
* Rotary Pump
* Thermal Pump
* Water Extractor

### Uses

It can be used as ammo for some turrets such as the Wave. It is also used as coolant for the Thorium Reactor and Force Projector. As a boost and coolant, it is used by higher tier Turrets. 

For producing Biomatter, it fuels the Cultivator. 
 
It is also usable for creating power, although it needs flammable materials to do so in a Turbine Generator.

In the process of Fracking using an Oil Extractor, it is needed along with sand. That is because fracking in reality uses water and sand, along with chemicals, to push the oil out of cracks in the ground.

Earlier it was mentioned that it can be used as ammo for the Wave. In that case, the Wave will automatically shoot water on blocks and terrain that are on fire. This is effective in situations where fire enemies like Titans are abundant and set blocks on fire constantly, or when there is a fire spreading.
